    <h3>Reason for taking this course</h3>
    <p>
        The reason I am taking this course is to learn how to make visually appealing websites. 
        I believe this course will give me a skill that is in high demand since the world
        we live in know is so heavily based off of the internet.
    </p>
    <h3>Experiance with web programming</h3>
    <p>
        My experiance with web programming is actually somewhat substantial because 
        i partly took an HTML/CSS/Javascript online course last winter and made a lot of progress.
    </p>
    <h3>Goals for this course</h3>
    <p>
        My goals for this course is to make beautiful, responsive websites and apps that
        could possibly make me more attractive to tech companies looking for an all around programmer (full stack). 
        I also want to learn about tghe ethics of web design and how they can be used to convey a message.
