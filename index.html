    <h3>Reason for taking this course</h3>
    <p>
        The reason I am taking this course is to learn how to make visually appealing websites. 
        I believe this course will give me a skill that is in high demand since the world
        we live in know is so heavily based off of the internet.
    </p>
    <h3>Experiance with web programming</h3>
    <p>
        My experiance with web programming is actually somewhat substantial because 
        i partly took an HTML/CSS/Javascript online course last winter and made a lot of progress.
