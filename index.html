        <h3>Reason for taking this course</h3>
        <p>
            The reason I am taking this course is to learn how to make visually appealing websites. 
            I believe this course will give me a skill that is in high demand since the world
            we live in know is so heavily based off of the internet.
        </p>
        <h3>Experiance with web programming</h3>
        <p>
            My experiance with web programming is actually somewhat substantial because 
            i partly took an HTML/CSS/Javascript online course last winter and made a lot of progress.
        </p>
        <h3>Goals for this course</h3>
        <p>
            My goals for this course is to make beautiful, responsive websites and apps that
            could possibly make me more attractive to tech companies looking for an all around programmer (full stack). 
            I also want to learn about tghe ethics of web design and how they can be used to convey a message.

                <li><a href = "https://www.apple.com/?afid=p238%7CseIEs444j-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_454212704807_pgrid_13945964887_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand-apple--slid---product-">Apple</a></li>
                <p>
                    I adore the Apple website because of its seamless transitions and the elegant way you traverse the page of a certain product.
                    Apple has a unique way of styling their website that many others cannot replicate.

                <p>
                    i am interested in this web project because of their goal of bettering the disparities in education in the Charlotte/Mecklenberg area.
                    They not only focus on the education but the underliying causes for this gap. Housing, zoning, tranportation, just to name a few.
                </p>
                <li><a href="https://camposcoffee.com/us/">Campus Coffee</a></li>
                <p>
                    What i like about this web project is that they are revolutionizing the way we get our coffee.
                    I'm not a coffee drinker but I see how game-changing they are. Not only are they provideing better 
                    coffee than your local grociery store, they are  emphasizing the growers of the coffee and showing their appreiaction
                    and helping make this product more substanable.
